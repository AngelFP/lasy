LASY Documentation
================================

LASY (LAser SYmple manipulator) code for manipulating laser pulses. It's primary function is to prepare, in a standard way,
laser pulses as inputs for a variety laser codes related to laser plasma acceleration although its functionality extends
beyond this. It has the ability to define both the transerse and longitudinaly profiles of a laser pulse
and then propagate that pulse over a user defined distance. The libraary can also incorporate experimentally generated data
such that simulations may be performed with realistic laser pulse inputs. 


This documentation needs fleshing out
